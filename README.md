dotfiles
========

Purpose of this repository is to keep track of the same dotfiles on different
machines and keep changes to those files in sync on different machines.

Different machines for a guy called dmaphy means: CentOS 5, CentOS 6, CentOS 7
and Fedora.

Presumably you know what you are doing if you are cloning this repo for your own
usage.
